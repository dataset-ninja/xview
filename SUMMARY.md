**DIUx xView: Objects in Context in Overhead Imagery 2018 Challenge** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the geospatial domain. 

The dataset consists of 1127 images with 601726 labeled objects belonging to 60 different classes including *building*, *small car*, *truck*, and other: *bus*, *cargo truck*, *vehicle lot*, *utility truck*, *trailer*, *truck w/box*, *dump truck*, *facility*, *storage tank*, *pickup truck*, *shed*, *passenger vehicle*, *truck w/flatbed*, *front loader/bulldozer*, *excavator*, *construction site*, *damaged building*, *shipping container lot*, *truck tractor*, *cargo plane*, *mobile crane*, *engineering vehicle*, *shipping container*, *motorboat*, *pylon*, and 32 more.

Images in the xView 2018 dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 281 (25% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (846 images) and *val* (281 images). Additionally, objects contain information about ***parent*** classes and ***coordinates***. Explore them in supervisely.. The dataset was released in 2018 by the DIU, USA.
