**DIUx xView: Objects in Context in Overhead Imagery 2018 Challenge** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the geospatial domain. 

The dataset consists of 1127 images with 601726 labeled objects belonging to 60 different classes including *building*, *small car*, *truck*, and other: *bus*, *cargo truck*, *vehicle lot*, *utility truck*, *trailer*, *truck w/box*, *dump truck*, *facility*, *storage tank*, *pickup truck*, *shed*, *passenger vehicle*, *truck w/flatbed*, *front loader/bulldozer*, *excavator*, *construction site*, *damaged building*, *shipping container lot*, *truck tractor*, *cargo plane*, *mobile crane*, *engineering vehicle*, *shipping container*, *motorboat*, *pylon*, and 32 more.

Images in the xView 2018 dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 281 (25% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (846 images) and *val* (281 images). Additionally, objects contain information about ***parent*** classes and ***coordinates***. Explore them in supervisely. The dataset was released in 2018 by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), USA.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
